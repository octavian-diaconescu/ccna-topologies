# ccna-topologies
A few topologies configured within the CCNA curriculum.

A topology includes: 
- [x] 3 different networks
- [x] IP calculations for every network, as well as assignable IPs based on the number of required users in a network
- [x] Switches configured for remote access with security in mind
- [x] Routers configured with static routing, DHCP, SSH and proper security (in the limits imposed by the first CCNA module)
- [x] A wireless router with a MAC-whitelist
- [x] FTP, email, dns, syslog server in a separate network
- [x] Properly tested services, all hosts communicate.
- [x] Dynamic routing configured with EIGRP, OSPF, RIPv2
- [x] Redundancy assured by the existence of multiple switches (access, distribution, core) with trunk and access link configuration
